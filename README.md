The most updated code on Deviant Art data gathering is on the development branch
1. Deviant Art Scrapper - is a jupyter notebook with code consisting of scraping the data from the website that couldnt be gathered from APIs and we thought would be needed.
2. Deviant download gallery - downloads the gallery of deviants gathered using random walk
3. Gall metadata deviant art - gathers gallery and metadata of deviants gathered using random walk
4. Watchers friends new - its called new because in the earlier version the deviant was not getting appended which would prohibit us to connect deviants with their watchers and friends. This code appends the deviants name to both their watchers and friends dataframes.
